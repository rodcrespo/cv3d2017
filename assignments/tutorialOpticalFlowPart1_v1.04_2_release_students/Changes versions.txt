v 1.01:

- added pause function, keyboard interface, hit 'p' to toggle.
- added framerate control. The application now has a target framerate of 25 frames/second. This will make application execution similar on all systems.
- fixed a bug that stopped the videoInput library from working. 


v 1.02 BETA (Major Update and extension of content):
bug fixes:
- Any width and height(not only square images) of videoinput now fully supported

updates:
- tutorial tasks extended
- tutorial pdf extended and improved
    - discusses and illustrates the problem with noise, multiple motions, deviations from brightness constancy
	- derivations properly formulated as error minimization techniques.
	- pdf style improved for readability and presentation (syntax highligting, and fully copy-pasteable code among others)
- file "ApertureIllustration" added, an interactive illustration of the aperture problem, including barberpole illustration and multiple motions
- implementation of Horn and Schunk included, but not used in the tutorial pdf (in.method = 'HS')
- temporal integration by recursive filtering added, to improve regularization and stability (in.tIntegration)


(see file exampleUsage.m):
- Saving and loading flow output supported (new input arguments)
- Generation of interactive test images now supports added features:
   - flicker
   - muliple motions
   - additive noise

   v 1.03 BETA 
updates:
- generation of groundtruth motion from test images now supported, see exampleUsage.m
- The horn and schunk optical flow has been remolded to look more like the original (same numerical solution)
- improved documentation

    v 1.04 BETA
Bug fixes
- mehotd "nothing" no longer crashes the application
- in.bRecordFlow will now be ignored for methods that do not produce optical flow

updates:
- improved the synthetic images. The nature and direction of the linear symmetry textures (parallell smooth bars) are now differently oriented with respect to the rotational motion
- method "edge" now has a correctly working interactive component. use keys R/F to increase/decrease the gamma parameter
- improved pdf.
